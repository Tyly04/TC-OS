# TC-OS
TC-OS is a program that is something you should never ever use. Really. It's designed to be crappy. The C in TC-OS stands for Crappy. Seriously, stay away from this.

However, if you really want to play this game:

# Starting TC-OS

1. Extract the files into a new folder.
2. Open the TC-OS UI Home.html. Everything else should work automatically.
